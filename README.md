# todo_list
 This is a simple todo list.
 This app follow crud using basic dart concepts. 
 I have used getX package for state management in the app. GetX package helps to easily pass arguments and makes the variable that needs to be updated be observable instead of refreshing the whole ui to reflec the changes.
